OVERVIEW: We begin with quick fluency tests. Then come tests of letter recognition and reading in several fonts. Some trials will, ask you to identify a brief letter in the corner of your eye, which is hard. So just relax and get as many as you can. You can track your progress by looking at the block counter in the lower right corner. Good luck.

This study requires fluency in Arabic.

OVERVIEW: We begin with quick fluency tests. Then come tests of letter recognition and reading in several fonts. Some trials will, ask you to identify a brief letter in the corner of your eye, which is hard. So just relax and get as many as you can. You can track your progress by looking at the block counter in the lower right corner. Good luck.

This study requires fluency in Arabic.

OVERVIEW: We begin with quick fluency tests. Then come tests of letter recognition and reading in several fonts. Some trials will, ask you to identify a brief letter in the corner of your eye, which is hard. So just relax and get as many as you can. You can track your progress by looking at the block counter in the lower right corner. Good luck.
